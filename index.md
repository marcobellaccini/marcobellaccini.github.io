## Biosketch
I was born in Rome, Italy in 1988.
I'm passionate about Science and Technology.

I got my Electronic Engineering BSc in 2010 and my Electronic Engineering MSc in 2013 (both with honors: 110 cum laude) from [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it).

My MSc thesis was about Human-Robot-Interaction. The [derived research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6907003) was presented at the [2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation](https://www.ieee-ras.org/component/rseventspro/event/18-icra-2014-ieee-international-conference-on-robotics-and-automation) in Hong Kong, China.

Then I worked for one year as Research Fellow at [The Biorobotics Institute](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/institute/biorobotics/biorobotics-institute) of [Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies](https://www.santannapisa.it) in Pontedera (Pisa, Italy).

I joined the TV Engineering Department of [RAI](https://www.rai.it/) in October 2014, where I work as IT Infrastructure architect for TV Production Systems.

I have a strong background in IT security (especially cryptography).

I'm a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) user since I was 14.

I'm an active member of the free-software community and a [greedy RFC reader](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5491).
